# INA219_WE
An Arduino library for the INA219 current and power sensor module.

It allows to set various ADC modes, gains and bus voltage ranges. Continuous mode, triggered mode, power down and ADC off mode are supported. Default shunt size is 0.1 ohms, but you can change it. 

I attached a list of public functions and a fritzing scheme for the example sketches.

Note: Version 1.1.2 corrected a misspelling of "continuous" which might lead to backwards incompatibilities. You might need to change your code.
